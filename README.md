# Panning for Gold
 This program accepts a map and searches for gold for you.

This program reads an inputted "map", or a text file formatted like this: a period stands for dirt, a dash stands for a rock with nothing under it, an upper case letter stands for a rock with gold hidden under it. 

The amount of gold is represented by the letter: A stands for one ounce, B stands for two ounces, and so on. There are no other characters on the map. 

You can check out the map1.txt, also in this directory, for an example. When run through the program, it should print 30, as the map displays one ounce (A), three ounces (C) and 26 ounces (Z).
